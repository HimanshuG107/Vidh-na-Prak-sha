This project focuses on developing a backend system for managing and storing data generated by various IoT devices in smart homes. We will integrate sensors such as temperature, humidity, motion detectors, and smart appliances to collect real-time data. The system will utilize both SQL and may be NoSQL (if required) databases to efficiently handle high-frequency data streams and maintain historical data for analysis.
Key features include:
Sensor Integration: Connect multiple IoT sensors to gather real-time data.
Data Management: Design a database architecture (Hybrid [(if required)] to store and manage sensor data.
Real-Time Processing: Implement a data ingestion layer for immediate monitoring and alerts.
Alerts and Notifications: Develop an alert system for critical events based on sensor readings.
Data Analysis: Enable reporting features to analyze energy usage and environmental conditions.
